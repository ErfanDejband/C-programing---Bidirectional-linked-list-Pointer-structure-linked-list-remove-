Then ask user to input number or delet the number. Then ask to chose the location of adding or deleting number.
If it is adding number ask user add number befor location or after location.
Some error also should be noted to user like:

**-there is NOT such location...**

**-No such choose !***

**-Nothing to delete**

Then by inputting **-1** it stop

## Code discription:
 1. Create a storage head <b> (tNumStorHead) </b> and intilazed it.
 
 2. Get input and get 1 for add number or 2 for delete number
 
 3. Add number:  we have diffrent condition
    - there is no node
    - there is only one node
    - there is more than one node

 4. delet number: same as add number we have different condition
    - nothing to delet
    - there is only one node
